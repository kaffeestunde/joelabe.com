              I went to meet Dean at Normand's around 3 so I could go home
              straight from the interview. He had cleaned himself up, and 
              looked more disturbing for it.

            In my memory, he had resembled your typical hobo from Victoria Park.
            Whoever showed up this time failed to fit any tropes and 
            instead stuck out like a sore thumb, 
            especially inside a cafe filled with people reading Proust. 
            Luckily there was a patio so we sat outside.
            
            <br/>
            <br/>

            His face hadn't looked odd before. I hadn't even noticed the cuts. 
            But now with the dirt washed off, the wounds against his cleanly washed
            skin imparted this weird aire--like he had the badges of a junkie but 
            underneath seemed anything but.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            The most bizarre part of his appearance was the hair. 
            He must've not known what he was doing, or decided to buzz it right before our interview and ran out of 
            time. The majority of his head was cropped close, but parts still had hair up to an inch long and 
            he looked like he had just escaped prison just as the guards were issuing the entrance haircut.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            I tried focusing on what he was saying,
            but my gaze couldn't overlook his appearances.
            My palms sweated thinking about botching the interview.  
            I kept busy by, frantically scribbling into my notebook and took sips
            from my latte. But the milk froth made me sweat more. 

            <br/>
            <br/>

            I thought of what Lucien had mentioned. How Carter's been impressed 
            with my work. And I remembered what Lucien said after that. About how 
            big this story about Mike Ma$$ could be. I had brushed it all off 
            at the time. Probably reflexively cause I didn't want to admit 
            it. But Lucien was right. If this Dean guy did really have as deep  
            an insight into Mike Ma$$ as everyone claims, then I do really 
            have the chance to start making some moves.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            So far I've been doing a fine job in the ranks. Writing stories 
            in the right style. With the right angles. Something safe that 
            Carter could throw into the nonstop cycle of content without angering 
            readers or making it look like we jumped the shark. So far I've been an 
            anonymous--someone you could replace with a bot and have none of the 
            readers notice.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            With the Mike Ma$$ story I could really make a name for myself
            as somebody West City looked to when they wanted an opinion 
            on art or music. Jeannie Hammond could be string of text that attracted 
            clicks rather than just another name they glossed over at the 
            beginning of an article. And once I had West City's attention and 
            respect, I'd finally have enough of a reputation to get 
            the hell out of here. Go back to New York. Hell, even Philly would do. 
            Anyplace other than West City.
