        Apparently, according people who had been at Lane's party that night, Mike had not thought it through, which everyone finds ironic since like you don't just off your self out of the blue. You ponder on it. Let it simmer for a long time. And so when he finally did it, it had to be a method you had been thinking about. So people thought he had been stupid to set himself on fire. Because of course it would take forever and be painful as fuck. That was one camp's argument. But then these other group of people came in arguing 
        
        'well what do you know? You don't know anything. If you're really in that situation you might lunge at any opportunity.'
        
        Looking back it's strange how people reacted. It was like they were trying to figure out who knew more about a suicidal mindset. It reminds me of Americans who've never been to England arguing over who had the British accent. Like both parties are ignorant but think only the other is. 
        
        Well anyways. I guess seeing how the world around Mike reacted to his death kind of put me off to everything. I no longer had the desire to do it myself and also I no longer felt connected to the people I was around.
        
        
        “Wow. Quite the day you've had.”
        “Yeah.” “How was yours?”
        “Fine. Just same as any other.”</div>

        After Dean left, 
        I sat staring out into the street. 
        It was just after 5. A lot of people were walking about and the cars were beginning to fill the streets. 
        Normands would soon be swamped, in less than half an hour so I only had a sliver of time to sit and think.

        After feeling the first urge to start packing up to leave 
        I instinctively reached for my empty cup. 
        I wished there was more coffee, even though I didn't need the caffeine. 
        I just craved the action of taking a drink. 
        I thought about what Tech might be doing. So I texted him. 
        And when he didn't respond right away, I called.

          We shouldn't have fucking signed. But, shit.
          Who around us knew right?

          Nobody we grew up with could imagine.

          <br/>
          <br/>
          The only path in their head was the beaten one,
          and not only were they unaware of alternative routes.
          They glorified, literally drooled at the idea of a record deal.

          <br/>
          <br/>

          People kept patting our backs. Telling us how great 
          we were doing. But walking in our own shoes, we actually knew 
          how it felt.

          And even though it felt like shit,
          when everyone's telling you how great you are, cheering you 
          on, it's near impossible to correct them. To not play along.

          <br/>
          <br/>
          It wasn't purely narcissistic either; though I get how easy
          it might be to see it that way.

          <br/>
          <br/>

          The more our community grew vested into us. 
          The more it felt our duty to put on this act. 
          To front like we were the stars they saw in us.

          <br/>
          <br/>

          But the position of success... potential success weighs heavy.  
          And it follows a regular, relentless schedule, knowing no concept 
          of work life balance. Just a constant beating of guilt and 
          anxiety-- and the worst FOMO imaginable. 

          <br/>
          <br/>

          Everyone around us talked about how they wanted their shot. 
          How if they had the chance we'd been given they'd be in the studio 
          24/7 and all. But they never knew what it felt like to 
          have this pressure. And they'd never understand. It was almost as 
          if they stopped listening to me. Assumed they 
          knew everything about me now that I had landed a deal.

          <br/>
          <br/>

          Honestly. After the second single flopped and the label 
          withheld our album release, I just 
          wanted to be back pulling beer behind the sticky bar at Rust. Wanted to 
          return to the days when I took three hour coffee breaks 
          right here. It's fucking ironic that I say 'the days' cause that makes it
          sound like the days of me working at Rust and being a regretful 
          'professional' musician were so far apart. But it wasn't even a 
          full year between.

          <br/>
          <br/>

          Time is brutal. 
          Eventually I got tired of hearing how grateful we should be. Got sick 
          of seeing the expectations in their faces.

          <br/>
          <br/>

          These were the same faces that had made my previous 'shitty' life 
          feel good. They were the faces I'd look forward to while scrubbing sludge 
          off the bartop. No matter how fucked politics or my money situation or
          whatever else got, these were the faces that made it alright.

          <br/>
          <br/>
        </p>

          I closed myself off. Didn't want to deal with anything real.

          <br/>

          Began ghosting people on text. 

          <br/>
          
          Responded to Mike only when he sought me first.

          <br/>

          But he was going through the same shit. So he eventually stopped reaching out.
          And obviously no music was being made.

          <br/>
          <br/>

          I hadn't lost grip with reality. I knew that the label would 
          eventually discover our lack of productivity. 
          And I figured that was a good a time as any to do it. Not any earlier.
          And I would've gone through with it had it not been for that single 
          favor I still owed.

          <br/>
          <br/>

          Lucy. She had moved to California straight out of high school.
          Dropped out of film school her second year. 
          Said it was a waste of time. I only knew this because I 
          had a crush on her and kept tabs on her over Facebook.

          <br/>
          <br/>

          Anyways, I owed her a big favor for a thing 
          in high school. That's a long story on its own I won't get into now.
          She emailed asking if 
          I'd have time to deliver a car to her.

          <br/>
          <br/>

          I figured I could wait until I made me and Lucy whole. 
          You know. Do one final positive thing.
          Maybe it'd make the final journey a pleasant one.

              I went to meet Dean at Normand's around 3 so I could go home
              straight from the interview. He had cleaned himself up, and 
              looked more disturbing for it.

            In my memory, he had resembled your typical hobo from Victoria Park.
            Whoever showed up this time failed to fit any tropes and 
            instead stuck out like a sore thumb, 
            especially inside a cafe filled with people reading Proust. 
            Luckily there was a patio so we sat outside.
            
            <br/>
            <br/>

            His face hadn't looked odd before. I hadn't even noticed the cuts. 
            But now with the dirt washed off, the wounds against his cleanly washed
            skin imparted this weird aire--like he had the badges of a junkie but 
            underneath seemed anything but.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            The most bizarre part of his appearance was the hair. 
            He must've not known what he was doing, or decided to buzz it right before our interview and ran out of 
            time. The majority of his head was cropped close, but parts still had hair up to an inch long and 
            he looked like he had just escaped prison just as the guards were issuing the entrance haircut.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            I tried focusing on what he was saying,
            but my gaze couldn't overlook his appearances.
            My palms sweated thinking about botching the interview.  
            I kept busy by, frantically scribbling into my notebook and took sips
            from my latte. But the milk froth made me sweat more. 

            <br/>
            <br/>

            I thought of what Lucien had mentioned. How Carter's been impressed 
            with my work. And I remembered what Lucien said after that. About how 
            big this story about Mike Ma$$ could be. I had brushed it all off 
            at the time. Probably reflexively cause I didn't want to admit 
            it. But Lucien was right. If this Dean guy did really have as deep  
            an insight into Mike Ma$$ as everyone claims, then I do really 
            have the chance to start making some moves.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            So far I've been doing a fine job in the ranks. Writing stories 
            in the right style. With the right angles. Something safe that 
            Carter could throw into the nonstop cycle of content without angering 
            readers or making it look like we jumped the shark. So far I've been an 
            anonymous--someone you could replace with a bot and have none of the 
            readers notice.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            With the Mike Ma$$ story I could really make a name for myself
            as somebody West City looked to when they wanted an opinion 
            on art or music. Jeannie Hammond could be string of text that attracted 
            clicks rather than just another name they glossed over at the 
            beginning of an article. And once I had West City's attention and 
            respect, I'd finally have enough of a reputation to get 
            the hell out of here. Go back to New York. Hell, even Philly would do. 
            Anyplace other than West City.
